## About Me

I am an assistant professor of Psychology at the University of California-Santa Cruz, and I direct the CRECE lab.

I will be accepting graduate students to start in Fall 2026 in UC-Santa Cruz. If you are interested in how children learn scientific and social concepts, how we can improve science education, or how culture influences children's understanding of death, please email me! You can also check out my lab's website: https://crecelab.sites.ucsc.edu/
