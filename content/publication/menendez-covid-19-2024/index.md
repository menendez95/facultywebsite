abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic brought unprecedented challenges to the lives of families
  and children, affecting children’s adjustment. We examined the impact COVID-19 had
  on families and how child-rearing disagreements might be linked to child adjustment.
  Furthermore, given the role that children play in evoking parent responses within
  the family context, we also investigated how children’s temperament trait of anger/frustration
  might moderate the indirect pathway through child-rearing disagreements. We recruited
  516 parents with a child between the ages 3 and 7 to complete an online survey measuring
  their perceived COVID-19 impact, and family and child functioning. Results indicate
  that greater COVID-19 impact, and child temperamental anger/frustration were each
  linked to greater child-rearing disagreements, and thereby, greater child stress.
  In addition, families reporting the most COVID-19 impact and having a child with
  high anger/frustration experienced the most child-rearing disagreements, and thereby,
  greater child anxiety during the pandemic. This work highlights how the COVID pandemic
  might have disrupted family processes, which in turn had negative consequences on
  the family, and suggest that less coparenting conflict might be a protective factor
  on the effect of the pandemic on child outcomes.
