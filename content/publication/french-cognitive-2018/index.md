abstract: 'We investigated children’s (n = 120; 3- to 11-year-olds) and adults’ (n
  = 18) reasoning about life-cycle changes in biological organisms by examining their
  endorsements of four different patterns of lifespan changes. Participants were presented
  with two separate tasks: (a) judging possible adult versions of a juvenile animal
  and (b) judging possible juvenile versions of an adult animal. The stimuli enabled
  us to examine the endorsement of four different patterns of change: identical growth,
  natural growth, dramatic change, and speciation. The results suggest that endorsement
  of the different patterns is inﬂuenced by age and familiarity. Young children and
  individuals confronted with unfamiliar organisms often endorsed an identical growth
  that emphasizes the stability of features over the life span and between parents
  and offspring. The results are interpreted as supporting the idea that cognitive
  constraints inﬂuence individuals’ reasoning about biological change and that the
  inﬂuence of these constraints is most notable when individuals are young or are
  presented with unfamiliar biological organisms.'
