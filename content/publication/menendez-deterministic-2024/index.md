abstract: 'Do children think of genetic inheritance as deterministic or probabilistic?
  In two novel tasks, children viewed the eye colors of animal parents and judged
  and selected possible phenotypes of offspring. Across three studies (N = 353, 162
  girls, 172 boys, 2 non-binary; 17 did not report gender) with predominantly White
  U.S. participants collected in 2019â€“2021, 4- to 12-year-old children showed a probabilistic
  understanding of genetic inheritance, and they accepted and expected variability
  in the genetic inheritance of eye color. Children did not show a mother bias but
  they did show two novel biases: perceptual similarity and sex-matching. These results
  held for unfamiliar animals and several physical traits (e.g., eye color, ear size,
  and fin type), and persisted after a lesson.'
