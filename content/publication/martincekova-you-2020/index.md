abstract: Using a mixed-methods approach, we examined how participants’ memories of
  socialization regarding death might influence their self-reported coping with losses
  in childhood and adulthood. We recruited 318 adults to complete an online survey.
  Path analyses indicated that participants who remembered their parents shielding
  them less from issues related to death reported better coping as children and adults.
  Qualitative responses suggested participants wanted to receive more information
  about death from their parents as they went through the grieving process. We highlight
  the potential benefits of socializing children about death, and how it may aid in
  their coping with death-related events.
