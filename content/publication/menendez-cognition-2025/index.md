abstract: Physically folding paper is a common activity performed by many children,
  but it is not mastered until middle-childhood. Paper folding ability has been the
  focus of studies motor development. There has been a long history in cognitive science
  of assessing spatial skills through mental paper folding tests. Despite the similarities
  between physical and mental paper folding, it is currently unknown whether there
  is a relation between physically and mentally folding paper. This study examined
  107, 3- to 8-year-old children in both skills. Our results show that children of
  all ages were able to physically fold paper, but became more accurate with age.
  Additionally, we found that there is a significant relation between physical and
  mental paper folding, and that this relation was robust to different statistical
  controls and statistical specifications. We discuss how these results influence
  our understanding of the co-development of cognitive and motor skills.
