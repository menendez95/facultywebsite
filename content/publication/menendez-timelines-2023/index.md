abstract: Visual representations of information are prevalent in many academic domains,
  and students must learn how to interpret and use these visual representations. How
  do students acquire this representational competence? Past work has focused on the
  role of explicit instruction. In this work, we consider another route for acquiring
  representational competence in the domain of biology. We argue that students develop
  representational competence with diagrams based on experience with diagrams with
  specific features. In two studies (Study 1 N = 161, Study 2 N = 195), we presented
  undergraduates with a lesson on metamorphosis with either a linear or circular depiction
  of the ladybug life cycle, two common arrangements for this type of diagram. We
  then assessed students’ life cycle drawings and their preferences for different
  features of life cycle diagrams. This brief exposure to diagrams with a particular
  feature led to changes in participants’ self-constructed diagrams and in their preferences
  for the specific diagrammatic features to which they were exposed. Our studies suggest
  that people develop representational competence, at least in part, by tracking the
  features present in the visualizations they see in their environments.
