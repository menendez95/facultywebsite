abstract: Children’s understanding of death has been a topic of interest to researchers
  investigating the development of children’s thinking and clinicians focusing on
  how children cope with the death of a loved one. Traditionally, researchers in cognitive
  development have studied death from a biological perspective. Current research suggests
  that exploring religious and spiritual conceptualizations might enrich our understanding
  of how children come to think about death. In this article, we review different
  methodological approaches that suggest that children form their understanding of
  death by engaging in conversations with and asking questions of family members,
  consuming cultural products, and participating in cultural rituals. We provide examples
  of how children combine different belief systems to form their understanding of
  death. We conclude by discussing recent research on how deathrelated socialization
  might be related to coping and bereavement after the death of a loved one.
