abstract: Prior work has shown that many undergraduate students have misconceptions
  about genetic inheritance, even after they take genetics courses. Visual representations,
  such as pedigree diagrams, are commonly used in genetics instruction, and they help
  students quickly visualize the phenotypes of multiple generations. In Study 1, we
  examined whether presenting a pedigree diagram of a wolf’s eye color in a rich and
  realistic manner (i.e., with rich perceptual images that resemble real animals)
  or in an abstract manner (i.e., with circles and squares representing animals) would
  help undergraduates learn from a brief, online lesson on inheritance of the wolf’s
  eye color, and whether they would transfer what they learned when reasoning about
  eye color in other species (near transfer) and other traits in other species (mid-
  and far transfer). Counter to our hypothesis, students transferred more with the
  rich diagram. In Study 2, we compared the rich diagram from Study 1 to a perceptually
  bland diagram (i.e., with color and textural features removed). There were no differences
  in students’ learning or transfer between the diagrams. These results suggest that
  realistic elements that are attention grabbing and easily interpretable by students
  can be beneficial for transfer in online lessons.
