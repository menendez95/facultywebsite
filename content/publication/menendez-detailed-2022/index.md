abstract: Visualizations are commonly used in educational materials; however, not
  all visualizations are equally effective at promoting learning. Prior research has
  supported the idea that both perceptually rich and bland visualizations are beneficial
  for learning and generalization. We investigated whether the perceptual richness
  of a life cycle diagram influenced children’s learning of metamorphosis, a concept
  that prior work suggests is difficult for people to generalize. Using identical
  materials, Study 1 (N = 76) examined learning and generalization of metamorphosis
  in first- and second-grade students, and Study 2 (N = 53) did so in fourth- and
  fifth-grade students. Bayesian regression analyses revealed that first and second
  graders learned more from the lesson with the perceptually rich diagram. In addition,
  fourth and fifth graders generalized more with the bland diagram, but these generalizations
  tended to be incorrect (i.e., generalizing metamorphosis to animals that do not
  undergo this type of change). These findings differ from prior research with adults,
  in which bland diagrams led to more correct generalizations, suggesting that the
  effect of perceptual richness on learning and generalization might change over development.
