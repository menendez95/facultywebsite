abstract: Research on mathematical cognition, learning, and instruction (MCLI) often
  takes cognition as its point of departure and considers instruction at a later point
  in the research cycle. In this article, we call for psychologists who study MCLI
  to reflect on the “status quo” of their research practices and to consider making
  instruction an earlier and more central aspect of their work. We encourage scholars
  of MCLI (a) to consider the needs of educators and schools when selecting research
  questions and developing interventions; (b) to compose research teams that are diverse
  in the personal, disciplinary, and occupational backgrounds of team members; (c)
  to make efforts to broaden participation in research and to conduct research in
  authentic settings; and (d) to communicate research in ways that are accessible
  to practitioners and to the general public. We argue that a more central consideration
  of instruction will lead to shifts that make research on MCLI more theoretically
  valuable, more actionable for educators, and more relevant to pressing societal
  challenges.
