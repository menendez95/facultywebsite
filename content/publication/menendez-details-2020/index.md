abstract: People often have difficulty in understanding processes of biological change,
  and they typically reject drastic life cycle changes such as metamorphosis, except
  for animals with which they are familiar. Even after a lesson about metamorphosis,
  people often do not generalize to animals not seen during the lesson. This might
  be partially due to the perceptual richness of the diagrams typically used during
  lessons on metamorphosis, which serves to emphasize the individual animal rather
  than a class of animals. In two studies, we examined whether the perceptual richness
  of a diagram influences adults' learning and transfer of knowledge about metamorphosis.
  One study was conducted in a laboratory setting, and the other was online. In both
  studies, adults who saw the bland diagram during the lesson accurately transferred
  more than adults who saw the rich diagram during the lesson.
