abstract: The term “disability” encompasses many conditions (including a range of
  learning, intellectual, physical, sensory and socioemotional disorders) that can
  be caused by a variety of genetic, environmental, and unknown factors. We examine
  how children reason about the biological nature of disabilities, specifically the
  extent to which they use 'essentialist', 'infectious disease', or 'bodily damage'
  causal models. These models provide competing predictions regarding the biological
  nature of disability. The essentialist model views disabilities as caused by an
  internal essence, akin to genes, and entails thinking of disabilities as stable,
  immutable, and inheritable. The infectious disease model views disabilities as communicable,
  abnormal, and needing intervention. The bodily damage model views disabilities as
  resulting from injuries or toxins, which maybe stable but are not inheritable or
  transmissible. We review what is known about children's acquisition of these models,
  and discuss how disentangling these biological models is a fruitful avenue for future
  research.
