abstract: The COVID-­19 pandemic in the United States has had a disproportionate impact
  on Black, low-­income, and elderly individuals. We recruited 175 predominantly white
  children ages 5–12 and their parents (N = 112) and asked which of two individuals
  (differing in age, gender, race, social class, or personality) was more likely to
  get sick with either COVID-­19 or the common cold and why. Children and parents
  reported that older adults were more likely to get sick than younger adults, but
  reported few differences based on gender, race, social class, or personality. Children
  predominantly used behavioral explanations, but older children used more biological
  and structural explanations. Thus, children have some understanding of health disparities,
  and their understanding increases with age.
