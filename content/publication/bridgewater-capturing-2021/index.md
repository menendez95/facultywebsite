abstract: We present three studies examining death in children’s animated films. Study
  1 is a content analysis of 49 films. We found that death is often portrayed in films,
  but many deaths occurred off-screen. Deaths were mostly portrayed in a biologically
  accurate manner, but some films portrayed biological misconceptions. Study 2 (n
  = 433) reports on parents’ attitudes and parentchild conversations about death in
  films. Children’s questions about death in animated films were similar to their
  questions about death more generally. Animated films may provide a context for parent-child
  conversations about death, as parents often watched these films with their children.
  However, it appeared that few parents took advantage of this opportunity to talk
  about death with their children.
