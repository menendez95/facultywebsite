abstract: People believe that treatments for illnesses are effective when they target
  the cause of the illness. Prior work suggests that biological essentialist explanations
  of mental illness lead people to prefer medications or other pharmacological treatments.
  However, prior work has not distinguished between biological and essentialist explanations.
  In three studies (total n = 517), we presented adults with vignettes about an individual
  with an artificial mental illness and manipulated the descriptions to emphasize
  or de-emphasize essentialist characteristics. Critically, none of the vignettes
  made reference to a biological basis for the disorder. Participants rated their
  willingness to interact with the person described in the vignettes and how effective
  they believed drug treatment and talk therapy would be on the mental illness. Across
  the three studies, describing mental illness with an essentialist framing led participants
  to think drug treatments would be more effective, but there was no effect for stigma
  or perceived effectiveness of talk therapy. This effect appears to be mediated by
  how much participants essentialized individuals with the disorder. The first framing
  that participants encountered seemed to shape their reasoning for the remainder
  of the study, even if they saw conflicting framing later on. The framing manipulation
  had similar effects for individuals with and without a mental illness. Results suggest
  that it is important to consider how mental illness is framed to the general public
  as it might impact peopleâ€™s treatment preferences.
