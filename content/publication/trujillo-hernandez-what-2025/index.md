abstract: "Information discussed between parents and children provide a foundation
  for children's developing understanding of health and illness. Parents of 3-to-7-year-old
  children (N = 516, 62% female, 78% White) residing in the United States were recruited
  using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk during July 29th– August 10th, 2020. We asked parents
  to report three questions that their children had asked about the COVID-19 pandemic
  and asked them to report how they responded to those questions. Children’s questions
  focused on lifestyle changes (22%), while parental responses were often about the
  virus (23%). We examined the stability of content of children’s questions and parental
  responses between the first peak and second peak of infection and death rates due
  to COVID-19 in the United States. The topic of children’s questions and the types
  of parental responses shifted between the two peaks, such that parents during the
  second peak of the pandemic reported their children asking more frequently about
  the virus and preventive measures than children in the first peak. Meanwhile, parents
  during the second peak of infection and death rates were more focused on responding
  to their children’s questions with information about the virus. We used Latent Class
  Analysis to explore overall patterns in children’s questions and parents’ responses.
  For children’s questions, three latent classes were obtained: (1) the virus [39%],
  (2) the virus/lifestyle changes [21%], and (3) lifestyle changes/preventive measures
  [40%]. For parents’ responses three latent classes were found: (1) the virus/self-protection
  [54%], (2) reassurance/the virus [28%], and (3) simple yes/no answers without further
  explanation [17%]. These results suggest that children’s questions and parental
  responses can be captured in terms of a discrete number of latent classes."
