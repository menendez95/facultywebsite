abstract: Parents are typically in charge of purchasing the food that their children
  eat, but little is known about how parents decide if particular foods are healthy
  for their children and how their beliefs about nutrition inﬂuence their children’s
  beliefs. In two studies, we investigated how parents of children ages 4–12 (N =
  826) make decisions about the healthiness of foods when presented with diﬀerent
  representations of the same nutritional information. Providing parents with nutritional
  information did not inﬂuence their ratings of how healthy food items are, compared
  to when they were shown only pictures of the foods. Parents reported talking with
  their children about nutrition, believed they are the best source of information
  for children about nutrition, and believed their nutrition beliefs inﬂuence their
  children’s beliefs. Our ﬁndings highlight the role of prior knowledge in food cognition
  and how beliefs about foods are transmitted from parents to children.
