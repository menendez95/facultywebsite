abstract: Public health data highlight disease outcome disparities corresponding to
  age, social class, and race, which are due to biological, behavioral, and/or structural
  factors (depending on the disparity). We examined whether adults are aware of these
  disparities and how they explain them. This study recruited U.S. adults (N = 241)
  through Mechanical Turk and examined whether they thought that there was a relation
  between social categories and illness. We examined their judgments and explanations
  for transmitting and contracting COVID-19 or the common cold. We found that adults
  thought that older adults and poor people were more likely than younger adults and
  rich people to get sick, whereas younger adults were more likely than older adults
  to transmit disease. People relied on biological explanations for disparities due
  to age, and structural explanations for disparities due to social class. However,
  the results for race were more mixed, suggesting that people do not always assume
  that social categories are related to illness.
