abstract: 'Why do people shift their strategies for solving problems? Past work has
  focused on the roles of contextual and individual factors in explaining whether
  people adopt new strategies when they are exposed to them. In this study, we examined
  a factor not considered in prior work: people’s evaluations of the strategies themselves.
  We presented undergraduate participants from a moderately selective university (N
  = 252; 64.8% women, 65.6% White, 67.6% who had taken calculus) with two strategies
  for solving algebraic word problems and asked them to rate these strategies and
  their own strategy on a variety of dimensions. Participants’ ratings loaded onto
  two factors, which we label quality and difﬁculty. Participants’ initial evaluations
  of the quality of the strategies were associated with whether they used the strategies
  at posttest, and this effect held even when controlling for individual and contextual
  factors. However, people’s evaluations of the difﬁculty of the strategies were not
  consistently associated with their later adoption of those strategies. We also examined
  individual and contextual predictors of strategy ratings and strategy adoption.
  Participants’ need for cognition and their spatial visualization ability were associated
  with their strategy evaluations, and the framing of the story problems was associated
  with their strategy adoption. The ﬁndings highlight that strategy adoption depends
  on multiple interacting factors, and that to understand strategy change, it is critical
  to examine how people evaluate strategies.'
