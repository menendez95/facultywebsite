 abstract = {We studied adults’ thinking about biology and found that they had some correct knowledge (such as understanding that offspring can look different from their parents), but also some misunderstandings (such as believing that offspring will resemble the parent of the same sex). This information can be used to tailor secondary and undergraduate genetics instruction to build on the knowledge students already have while correcting the misunderstandings they might hold.},
