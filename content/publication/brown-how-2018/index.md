abstract: 'What factors affect whether learners adopt a new problemsolving strategy?
  Potential factors include learnersâ€™ evaluations of alternative strategies and the
  degree of similarity between their existing strategy and the alternatives. A first
  step in answering this question is investigating how people evaluate strategies.
  This exploratory study investigated how people evaluate strategies for solving algebraic
  word problems, and how these evaluations vary as function of individual differences.
  Undergraduates rated three strategies on six dimensions and judged each pair of
  strategies for similarity. Factor analysis showed that evaluations could be reduced
  to two constructs: efficiency and intuitiveness. We calculated factor scores for
  each participant for each strategy. Efficiency did not predict similarity ratings
  on its own, but it did interact with Need for Cognition. These results suggest stable
  learner characteristics and moment-to-moment evaluations of strategies influence
  judgments about strategy similarity.'
