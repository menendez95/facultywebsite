abstract: 'Having a robust understanding of viruses is critical for children to understand
  the COVID-19 pandemic and the protective measures recommended to promote their safety.
  However, viral transmission is not part of current educational standards in the
  United States, so children likely must learn about it through informal means, such
  as media and conversations with caregivers—contexts that often animate and anthropomorphize
  viruses. In this registered report, we developed an at-home educational intervention
  to teach children about viruses by creating a picture storybook about COVID-19.
  We tested children ages 5–8 on their understanding of viruses before and after reading
  the book at home with their caregivers. Critically, we manipulated which of three
  books children received: realistic (that detailed the microscopic processes involved
  in COVID-19 transmission), anthropomorphic (that depicted all the same information
  but using anthropomorphic language and images for COVID-19), or control (that only
  showed the visible aspects of illness). Bayesian analyses revealed that children
  learned about COVID-19 by reading the picture books with their parents at home and
  extended this knowledge to other viruses and that learning was substantially higher
  for those reading the realistic and anthropomorphic books than the control books.
  We also found that learning did not differ as a function of whether the book used
  anthropomorphic depictions or not although children reading the anthropomorphic
  book reported being less afraid of viruses. Altogether, these results demonstrate
  that carefully constructed picture books can help children learn about complex scientific
  topics at home. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)'
