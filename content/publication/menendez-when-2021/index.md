abstract: Parent-child conversations are important for children’s cognitive development,
  children’s ability to cope with stressful events, and can shape children’s beliefs
  about the causes of illness. In the context of a global pandemic, families have
  faced a multitude of challenges, including changes to their routines, that they
  need to convey to their children. Thus, parent-child conversations about the coronavirus
  pandemic might convey information about the causes of illness, but also about how
  and why it is necessary for children to modify their behaviors to comply with new
  social norms and medical guidance. The main goal of this study was to examine the
  questions children ask about the COVID-19 pandemic and how parents answer them.
  This survey included responses from a national sample of 349 predominantly white
  parents of children between the ages of 3 and 12 recruited through Amazon’s Mechanical
  Turk in United States. Parents reported that although children asked about COVID-19
  and its causes (17.3%), children asked primarily about lifestyle changes that occurred
  as a result of the pandemic (24.0%) and safety (18.4%). Parents reported answering
  these questions by emphasizing that the purpose of different preventative measures
  was to protect the child (11.8%) or the family (42.7%) and providing reassurance
  (13.3%). Many parents discussed how it was their social responsibility to slow the
  spread of the virus (38.4%). Parents of younger children tended to shield them from
  information about COVID-19 (p = .038), while parents with more knowledge were more
  likely to provide explanations (p textless .001). Our analysis shows that families
  not only discuss information about the virus but also information about changes
  to their lifestyle, preventative measures, and social norms.
