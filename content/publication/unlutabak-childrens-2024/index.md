abstract: Question-asking is a crucial tool for acquiring information about unseen
  entities, such as viruses; thus, examining children’s questions within the context
  of COVID-19 is particularly important for understanding children’s learning about
  the coronavirus. The study examined 3-12-year-old children’s questions and teachers’
  responses about the COVID-19 pandemic in Türkiye, a non-Western developing context,
  and the United States, a Western cultural context. A total of 119 teachers from
  Türkiye and 95 teachers from the US participated in the study. Teachers completed
  an online survey consisting of a demographic form and a questionnaire asking them
  to report three questions about COVID-19 asked by children in their classrooms and
  their responses to these questions. We analyzed children’s questions and teachers’
  responses for their type and content and examined demographic factors associated
  with children’s questions and teachers’ responses. Consistent with the literature,
  children from Türkiye asked fewer explanation-seeking (i.e., why/how) questions
  than children from the United States. Children asked questions about viruses and
  precautions. Teachers responded to children’s questions realistically in both countries.
  The findings have important implications for how children gain knowledge from teachers
  when discussing health, disease, and virus topics in two countries.
