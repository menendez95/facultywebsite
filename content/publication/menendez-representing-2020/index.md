abstract: Two foundational concepts in biology education are 1) offspring are not
  identical to their parents, and 2) organisms undergo changes throughout their lives.
  These concepts are included in both international and U.S. curricular standards.
  Research in psychology has shown that children often have difficulty understanding
  these concepts, as they are inconsistent with their intuitive theories of the biological
  world. Additionally, prior research suggests that diagrams are commonly used in
  instruction and that their features influence student learning. Given this prior
  work, we explored the characteristics of life cycle diagrams and discuss possible
  implications for student learning. We examined 75 life cycle diagrams from books,
  including five biology or general science textbooks and 25 specialized trade books
  focusing on biology for children. We also examined 633 life cycle diagrams from
  a publicly available online database of science diagrams. Most diagrams failed to
  show any within-species variability. Additionally, many diagrams had perceptually
  rich backgrounds, which prior research suggests might hinder learning. We discuss
  how the design characteristics of diagrams may reinforce students’ intuitive theories
  of biology, which might make it difficult for students to understand key biological
  concepts in the future.
